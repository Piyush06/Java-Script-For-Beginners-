# Java-Script-For-Beginners-

Hello User,

This Repository completely focuses on the audiences who are known to Front-end Development and which are new to Javascript.

The methodology for this repo is really simple, I'll add few commits everyday covering Bottom to the no-end of JS.
Their will be 2 Files which you have to concentrate on each day, one will be the Introduction repo of the topic and the other would be the example for DIY(Do it yourself) kinda file which I suggest you to go through first then just copy paste the code in any editor of your choice and try different thing out of it..

Cheers, Their will be never a ending curve for any programming language new things appear each day.. Hence I'm using a day to day commits so you will be updated with Me on the go!

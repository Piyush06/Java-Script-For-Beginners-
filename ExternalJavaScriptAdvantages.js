//Placing Scripts in external files has some advantages:

// - It separates HTML and code
// - It makes html and JS easier to read and maintain
// - Cached JavaScript files can sped up page loads

//To add several script files to one page - use several script tags:

//Example

<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
<script src="myScript2.js"></script>
